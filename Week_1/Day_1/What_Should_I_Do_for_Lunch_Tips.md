### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.
```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry === true) {
    if (availableTime <= 20) {
      console.log("Pick something up and eat it in the lab");
    } else if (availableTime > 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log("Try a place nearby");
    } else if (availableTime > 30) {
      console.log("I am in a bootcamp and that I should reconsider how much time we actually have to spare");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("get back to work");
  }
};
```
